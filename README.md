## Introduction

Rust is a common issue in various industries, and its detection is crucial for maintenance and safety. This project leverages XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to create a rust detection model. The trained model can classify images and identify the presence of rust, making it valuable for predictive maintenance and quality control.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- An AWS account with necessary permissions.
- AWS CLI and SageMaker Python SDK installed.
- A dataset of images for training and validation.

### Installation

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   cd repo
   ```
   Set up your AWS credentials and configure the AWS CLI with aws configure.

## Usage

### Training

- Upload your training and validation data to an S3 bucket.
- Update the data locations in the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
- Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the XGBoost model on SageMaker.

### Deployment

- Deploy the trained model as a SageMaker endpoint.
- Create an endpoint configuration and update the endpoint name in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
- Deploy the endpoint.
